# Java Learning Notes

This repository contains Java programs and notes on various core concepts I am studying. The files include examples and explanations of fundamental Java topics like collections, iterators, hash maps, and object comparison.

## üìÇ Topics Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Comparator & Comparable (`Comparator_and_Comparable.java`)**
- Understanding **`Comparable`** (natural ordering) vs. **`Comparator`** (custom sorting logic).
- Examples of sorting objects in different ways.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Copy-On-Write ArrayList (`Copy_write_arrayList.java`)**
- Learning how **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`** works in a multi-threaded environment.
- How it prevents `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Equality & HashCode (`Equality_and_hashcode.java`)**
- Importance of **`equals()`** and **`hashCode()`** in collections.
- How hash-based collections (like `HashSet` and `HashMap`) use these methods.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **HashMap Basics (`HashmapExample.java`)**
- Understanding key-value storage in **`HashMap`**.
- Hashing mechanism and collision resolution.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Iterator in Java (`IteratorExample.java`)**
- Learning how **`Iterator`** works for safe traversal of collections.
- Difference between **fail-fast** and **fail-safe** iterators.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Interface (`Sets.java`)**
- Exploring different types of Sets: **`HashSet`**, **`TreeSet`**, and **`LinkedHashSet`**.
- Their ordering behavior and use cases.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **WeakHashSet (`WeakHashset.java`)**
- How **`WeakHashSet`** allows garbage collection of unused keys.
- When to use it for memory efficiency.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **ArrayList Basics (`arraylist.java`)**
- Internal structure and operations of **`ArrayList`**.
- Performance comparison with `LinkedList`.
